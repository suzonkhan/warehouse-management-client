            <p>
              <strong>Nodejs:</strong> If your server side code requires very
              few cpu cycles. In other world you are doing non blocking
              operation and does not have heavy algorithm/Job which consumes
              lots of CPU cycles.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>MongoDB:</strong> MongoDB are a good choice when your data
              is document-centric.{" "}

              What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work?
            </h4>
            <p> <strong>Purpose: </strong>
              JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
              information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT
              contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims.
            </p>
            <p><strong>It work process:</strong>
              JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of
              claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two
              parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand.{" "}
